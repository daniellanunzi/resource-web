                <div class="body-copy"> In the 15th century ballet was mainly performed in courts by aristocrats as there were no professional dancers at this time. The adorned costumes worn by these performers were meant to leave a lasting impression on viewers. While they were highly decorated, these costumes restricted the movement of the performers. </div>

                <div class="body-copy"> Costumes in the 17th century were very creative and unique, but due to the size and weight of them, movement was still restricted. Female dancers would wear costumes that looked like court dresses with trains paired with wigs, jewels and heeled shoes. Male dancers, in certain performances, wore costumes with a wired skirt. In certain instances both female and male dancers would wear leather masks in performances to further convey the character they were playing. </div>

                <div class="body-copy"> In the early 18th century the ballerina Marie Camargo shortened her skirts as well as created slippers without heels to assist in displaying her complicated footwork to the audiences. Jean-Georges Noverre abolished costume details such as the leather mask and panniers, which were overskirts to create more volume in the actual skirt, replacing them with tunics that were reminiscent of Grecian robes.</div>

                <div class="body-copy"> After the French Revolution occurred in 1789, women in society wore Grecian-style dresses that highlighted their bodes. This style of dress made its way into dance as well which was beneficial as movement was no longer restricted. Male dance costumes during this time period also followed fashion trends. Since both female and male dance costumes allowed a greater range of movement, they were able to dance with one another.</div>

                <div class="body-copy"> Ballet costume design in the 18th century was very innovative and creative. One of the key developments that came out of this time period was the creation of tights, in 1790, which allowed greater movement resulting in the creation of new ballet steps.</div>

                <div class="body-copy">The evolution of the tutu is important to note during the 19th century as it became the standard. Beginning in 1832, dancer Marie Taglioni presented the “Romantic tutu” which consisted of a midcalf layered skirt, which was shortened in the 1880s to expose the enitre leg. In 1870, the “Classical tutu” was introduced which was stiff and reached the knee. A kind of Classical tutu, known as the “Pancake,” was popular which was flat, wide, and held together with hoops and layered netting.</div>

                <div class="body-copy"> During the 20th century the idea of orientalism influenced ballet costuming merging tunics and veils wrapped around the dancers body with the standard tutu. There was also an interest in modernity during this time period. Traditional ballets were still performed in traditional costuming, but modern ballets had a unique contemporary style such as female dancers performing in leotards and tights and male dancers performing shirtless.</div>
