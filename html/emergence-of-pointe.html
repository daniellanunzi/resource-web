            <div id="what-is-pointe-info-1"> When learning how to Ballet dance, dancers first become accustomed with flat ballet slippers in order to learn the intricate technique Ballet requires. Eventually, usually female dancers will begin learning how to dance en pointe. Dancing en pointe requires a different kind of shoes. Pointe shoes allow a dancer to dance directly on the tips of their toes. In order to do so safely, the dancer has to learn more technique specifically for pointe.</div>

            <div id="what-is-pointe-info-2"> In order to begin dancing en pointe, dancers do exercises to strengthen their ankles in addition to foot flexibility to train the foot for the pointe shoe. It is hard work to be able to dance en pointe, but the ballerina is trained to make it look effortless, creating the mystical qualities seen on stage at ballet performances! </div>

        <div class="history-info-subheading-1730s"> 1730s </div>
        <div class="history-info-1730s"> Initially, when ballet’s were performed in Europe courts, heeled shoes were worn until Marie Camargo, who performed at the Paris Opéra, removed her heels creating the first step towards the flat slipper. This slipper allowed Marie a greater range of movement that was not possible with the heeled shoes such as more dynamic jumps.</div>

        <div class="history-info-subheading-1790s"> 1790s </div>
        <div class="history-info-1790s"> The idea of dancing en pointe can be traced back to Charles Didot who was a dancer and choreographer at the Paris Opéra. He created a system in which the dancer could be raised into the air on stage. Prior to the dancer being raised, the system would raise the dancer onto the tips of their toes, similar to how a dancer would dance en pointe. </div>

        <div class="history-info-subheading-1823"> 1823 </div>
        <div class="history-info-1823"> In La Fée et le Chevalier Amalia Brugnoli performed en pointe with square-toed satin slippers. This pointework was very different from what we know today, as she had to exert herself to get on her toes, using her arms to assist her. She inspired other dancers to learn to dance en pointe. </div>
        
        <div class="history-info-subheading-1832"> 1832 </div>
        <div class="history-info-1832"> In La Sylphide, choreographed by her father Filippo Taglioni, Marie Taglioni became the first ballerina to perform a full ballet en pointe and is attributed to introducing pointe. She used her pointe shoes to assist in demonstrating her characters to the audience. The shoes she wore were tight satin slippers with ribbons and leather soles. Ballerinas that followed Marie, such as Fanny Elssler, combined quick footwork with pointe which added to the development of pointe. </div>

        <div class="history-info-subheading-1870s-1890s"> 1870s-1890s </div>
        <div class="history-info-1870s-1890s"> Italian shoemakers created stronger pointe shoes by hardening the box with materials like newspaper, flour, paste, pasteboard, and leather allowing dancers to stand en pointe longer as well as perform pirouettes en pointe. Marius Petipa was inspired to include pointework in his dances to further develop his characters after Italian dancers had travelled to Russia. For example, he used pointe in The Sleeping Beauty to convey a sense of grace in Princess Aurora through sustained balances.</div>
        
        <div class="history-info-subheading-1910s-1930s"> 1910s-1930s </div>
        <div class="history-info-1910s-1930s"> Prima ballerina Anna Pavlova had very high arches which required her to stabilize her shoes with leather soles and a harder box. When she travelled to the United States in 1910, her company wore shoes made by Salvatore Capezio, which became the first pointe shoe brand on an international scale. The Capezio brand is still around today! Pavlova’s shoes, however, were still unstable due to a rounded toe and slim vamp. </div>

        <div class="history-info-subheading-1920s-1980s"> 1920s-1980s </div>
        <div class="history-info-1920s-1980s"> In the 20th century pointe vocabulary and technique emerged more thoroughly, especially with Ballet Russes and George Balanchine. Other figures like Bronislava Nijinska and William Forsythe pushed the development of pointe technique which required pointe shoes to be more supportive and reinforced leading to developments like the flat platform that is still around today! Also, in the early 1970s ballet became more inclusive as the Dance Theatre of Harlem included different shades of tights, pointe shoes, and ribbons to better match dancer’s skin tones.</div>
        
        <div class="history-info-subheading-1990s-Today"> 1990s-Today </div>
        <div class="history-info-1990s-Today"> Recently, more innovations have emerged with training and safety in terms of pointe. Pointe shoe manufacturers and companies have begun providing inclusive shade ranges so that dancers do not have to cover their pointe shoes in makeup to match their skin tone. Also, research in terms of dance medicine has assisted in the safety of pointe including correct strengthening and training to instill confidence in the dancer prior to performing en pointe. </div>

        <div class="history-info-subheading-men-en-pointe"> Men En Pointe </div>
        <div class="history-info-men-en-pointe"> In the past, men en pointe was used for comedy or to depict women. However, recently there has been reconsideration of the thought of men performing en pointe as, for example, in 2019 the pointe shoe company Siberian Swan released a shoe model designed for men. The effort and strength training that it takes to prepare to dance en pointe can be beneficial for all dancers to participate in. Men dancing en pointe will continue pushing ballet in the right direction of inclusivity! </div>
