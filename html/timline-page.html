                <div class="body-copy"> Ballet was first introduced as a tradition intertwined with opera that was mainly enjoyed by privileged individuals who would often host these performances in areas of their palaces. King Louis XIV was a strong supporter of ballet, often dancing in them relating to his nickname, Sun King, after he had performed as the Sun God Apollo in his early teenage years. When the French court began to disregard the arts, King Louis XIV founded two academies which allowed ballet to re-enter the art scene. </div>

                <div class="body-copy"> The Académie Royale de Danse was one of two academies founded by Louis XIV and established in 1661. This academy pushed the development of ballet in a new direction. At this academy, it became possible for dancers to be professionally trained. Due to this advancement, ballet shifted from a court entertainment source to one of the theaters. During the development of ballet, the focus was drawn to male dancers, but in 1681 Mlle La Fontaine became the first principal female dancer. </div>

                <div class="body-copy"> The second academy founded by Louis XIV was Académie Royale de Musique which was established in 1669. At this academy, the intertwined nature of ballet and opera was present. During the latter half of the 17th century, ballet and opera began to flourish independently.</div>

                <div class="body-copy"> The flat slipper emerged allowing a new range of motion in the foot and training on demi-pointe while ballet techniques continued to evolve. Additionally, The Code of Terpsichore was created by Carlo Blasis including set exercises that were used to base ballet technique such as 90 degree turnout. Many of his theories are still apparent in ballet technique. In 1789 the French Revolution occurred which eradicated the connection between the Paris Opéra with the court.</div>

                <div class="body-copy"> The 19th century brought forth a popularity for ballet largely due to Pierre Gardel. Gardel was a prominent figure in the ballet world between 1787-1827. Due to this growing popularity, ballet began to spread to other areas in Europe. During the 19th century, Romanticism became extremely popular. In 1830 the Bourbon monarchy collapsed causing the Opéra to become privatized. With this privatization, the new intriguing style of Romanticism found its way into ballet.</div>

                <div class="body-copy"> During this time the ballerina became an even more prominent figure, especially due to new qualities of movement and technique due to pointe. These years also brought forth respected ballerinas such as Marie Taligoni, Fanny Elssler and Carlotta Grisi (take a look at the key figures page to learn more). Another shift in ballet occurred while the world shifted due to the fall of Napoleon in 1851. The middle class became more wealthy and a wider variety of people attended ballets at Parisian theatres.</div>

                <div class="body-copy"> Ballet emerged in St Petersburg in addition to a Russian style of ballet. Ballet training was very important in this style. The Russian style of ballet was based off of the Italian style by Enrico Cecchetti and the French style by Christian Johansson. Post World War I Diaghilev brought modern art movements into ballet to once again push ballet into a new direction. </div>

                <div class="body-copy"> In 1909 Serge Diaghilev established the company Ballet Russes in Paris highlighting important Imperial ballet dancers. Marius Petipa was an important figure during this time. Ballet became an extremely popular source of entertainment thanks to the combination of the dancers, stage and music to create an overall experience for viewers. </div>

                <div class="body-copy"> In 1917 the Russian Revolution took place which affected the connection between Ballet Russes and Russia, but the Russian style stayed prominent in the company. Dancers of other backgrounds began joining as well. A few years after the death of Diaghilev the Ballet Russes de Monte Carlo began touring the United States in 1933 leading to ballet gaining popularity in North America. The New York City Ballet established in 1934 and the American Ballet Theatre in 1939. </div>

The world became divided into two sides, the East and West, which both had differing ideas about what art and ballet should be. The West applauded innovations and experimentation with art and ballet whereas the East put an emphasis on politics in art.</div>
