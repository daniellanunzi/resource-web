        <div id="section-1-info"> Marie Taglioni was an Italian ballerina trained by her father, Filippo Taglioni, and was the most distinguished ballerina of her time. Her elegant dancing which was described to extend from the stage to the audience’s soul characterized the Romantic style in the early 19th century. When she performed in her father’s ballet La Sylphide, in March 1832, she became the first ballerina to perform a full routine en pointe. Her dancing en pointe developed a new style within ballet dance including jumps and sustained balances en pointe, such as an arabesque. Not only did she make key innovations in the emergence of pointe, but the costume, tight bodice and skirt, she wore in this ballet pushed toward the iconic tutu we associate with ballet today. Marie Taglioni made great innovations in ballet and pointe, being classified as one of the greatest classical ballerinas. </div>

        <div id="section-2-info"> Fanny Elssler was an impressive ballet dancer, from her performance to technique, who is credited with the introduction of character dance in ballet. She trained in ballet from her childhood and began performing at the Paris Opéra in 1834. She became famous from her Polish Folk dance in La Gypsy, 1839, as well as her introduction of Spanish cachucha in Le Diable Boiteux, 1836. Her rival was Marie Taglioni, each having individual performance qualities. Marie was known for her elegance while Fanny was known for her enthusiasm. Due to this, when she attempted to dethrone Marie as the greatest classical ballerina, she performed in La Sylphide, but failed due to her opposing dance quality. In 1840-1842 she toured the United States and broke her contract with the Paris Opéra to continue touring around the world and eventually retired in 1851.</div>

        <div id="section-3-info"> Carlotta Grisi was an Italian ballerina during the Romantic era known for creating the title role in Giselle as well as merging the opposing dance qualities of Marie Taglioni and Fanny Elssler. From a young age Carlotta trained in ballet, but since her family was poor she was taken out of school and at 10 years old joined a touring opera company. In 1834 she joined the ballet company of the San Carlo Naples where Jules Perrot shaped her into the successful ballerina she became. At the Paris Opéra her first creation was the title role for Giselle in 1841 and was the principal ballerina there until 1849. She also performed in many ballets in London during this time. The last leg of her career was in St Petersburg between 1850-1853 while Jules Perrot was ballet master. Carlotta Grisi’s last performance was in Warsaw in 1853. </div>

        <div id="section-4-info"> Marius Petipa was a successful dancer and choreographer at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg that influenced modern ballet, especially in Russia from 1870-1903. Marius’ ballet training traces back to his father Jean Petipa, who was a ballet master. His first performance at the Mariinsky Theatre was in the 1847 performance of Paquita. Nearly ten years later, in 1858, he presented his first original ballet Un Mariage sous la Régence (“A Regency Marriage”). He became choreographer in 1862 then promoted to chief choreographer in 1869. Many of the ballets that he created are still performed today! He collaborated with Tchaikovsky on popular ballets such as, The Nutcracker, The Sleeping Beauty, and versions of Swan Lake and Giselle. </div>

        <div id="section-5-info"> Serge Diaghilev was an arts advocate who created a lasting impact in ballet who revitalized the love for ballet, modernized it and organized the Ballet Russes in 1909. From a young age he loved the arts, graduating with a law degree, yet wanting to pursue music. Due to his personal art influences he opened the Ballet Russes in 1909. The choreography in the company was unique and innovative, creating a new quality of movement in ballet. He wanted to create new ballets, hiring many different choreographers, composers, and dancers to accomplish this dream while still having total control over his productions. His company toured in areas around the world, including America and Europe, rekindling the interest in ballet in these countries. Serge Diaghilev is credited with making lasting impacts in ballet following his death, creating a modern classical ballet unlike anything before.</div>
